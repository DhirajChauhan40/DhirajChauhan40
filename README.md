###  About me
Hello! I'm Dhiraj, a third-year CS student from India, a software developer who likes to build stuff that makes a difference in the world.
I usually work on **Android development**, **Web development**, and **Solana blockchain**.

I believe in public learning, and I am constantly eager to learn new things and enjoy sharing what I have learned with others. I love interacting with folks and helping community members is what I like to do daily.

I love to [speak](https://talks.cdhiraj40.dev/) and have conducted multiple sessions to encourage and mentor students toward **programming**, **open source**, and **building tech communities**.
